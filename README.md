This is not my about me webpage
This is a page in which I work on sourcing materials into the page and linking them up correctly. Relative paths!!
Struggled with the initial assignment, not knowing what I was supposed to be doing, but once I harassed Paul on Slack he helped me understand. 

basically, as far as I can tell, we're trying to link up the CSS with the repository with the folder so the html knows where to pull sources from. 

We're also making sure the links work, the images work. I got the links and images pretty quick but I'm struggling to make the html and css as clean as possible. 

I'm struggling to join things in HTML and CSS, losing track of what goes where and how I get them to talk to each other. I'm going to practice that more today (9/24)

It turns out that I was pushing the wrong css file. Pushing the correct CSS file has made the CSS editing endeavor quite a bit easier. Funny how that works out. 

Still working on combining redundant CSS lines. Hmm. 

So, just to reiterate, when you change the correct file and link the correct files together, it is a lot easier. Kind of like how swimming with floaties is easier than swimming with an anvil. 

Added reset.css which means I have to (get to) tinker with the fonts and sizes

Played with fonts, now struggling to get my images into github pages. 

When I keep images in a subfolder, they don't load. Which is weird because I'm pretty sure I linked them correctly. As of right now I'm not putting them in a subfolder but I'd like to know why.
